Space Weather Forecasting Using Machine Learning Table of Contents Project Overview Motivation Dataset Methodology Machine Learning Models Installation Usage Results Future Work Contributing License Project Overview This project focuses on forecasting space weather by predicting solar flares and assessing their potential impact on Earthâ€™s environment. Solar flares are intense bursts of electromagnetic radiation from the Sun, posing risks to technologies such as:
Satellite operations Power grids Communication systems Using machine learning, we aim to create reliable models to forecast solar flare events, thereby helping to mitigate these risks.

Motivation As our dependency on space-based technology grows, accurate space weather forecasting becomes crucial. Solar flares pose risks to critical infrastructures, including GPS systems, satellites, and even human space missions. This project seeks to enhance prediction accuracy for solar flares using machine learning models trained on historical solar data, making space weather forecasting more effective.

Dataset The dataset includes historical observations of solar flares, with information on:

Solar flare classes (e.g., X, M, C classes, based on intensity) Observation times, durations, and locations on the Sun Related solar wind and magnetic field data Data Sources: NASAâ€™s GOES satellite data, SOHO, or other relevant solar observatories.
