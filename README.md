Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting space weather by predicting solar flares and assessing their potential impact on Earthâ€™s environment. Solar flares are intense bursts of electromagnetic radiation from the Sun, posing risks to technologies such as:

Satellite operations
Power grids
Communication systems
Using machine learning, we aim to create reliable models to forecast solar flare events, thereby helping to mitigate these risks.

Motivation
As our dependency on space-based technology grows, accurate space weather forecasting becomes crucial. Solar flares pose risks to critical infrastructures, including GPS systems, satellites, and even human space missions. This project seeks to enhance prediction accuracy for solar flares using machine learning models trained on historical solar data, making space weather forecasting more effective.

Dataset
The dataset includes historical observations of solar flares, with information on:

Solar flare classes (e.g., X, M, C classes, based on intensity)
Observation times, durations, and locations on the Sun
Related solar wind and magnetic field data
Data Sources: NASAâ€™s GOES satellite data, SOHO, or other relevant solar observatories.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned to remove inconsistencies, with steps including:

Normalization for consistency across models
Feature Engineering to create meaningful predictive features
Handling Missing Values using interpolation
Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
The data undergoes several preprocessing steps:

Normalization: Standardizing features for optimized model performance.
Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting features that capture essential patterns.
Handling Missing Values: Filling missing values with interpolation methods.
2. Model Selection
We experiment with multiple machine learning models, evaluated based on metrics like:

Accuracy
Precision & Recall
F1-score
3. Model Training and Evaluation
The models are trained on historical data and cross-validated to ensure robustness and improve predictive accuracy.

Machine Learning Models
This project evaluates various models to find the most effective for solar flare forecasting:

Random Forest Classifier: Provides robust, interpretable predictions with an ensemble of decision trees.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Known for high-dimensional effectiveness, making it suitable for classification tasks.
