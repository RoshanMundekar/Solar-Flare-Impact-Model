Project Overview
This project aims to forecast space weather, specifically focusing on predicting solar flares and their potential impact on Earth's environment. Solar flares are intense bursts of electromagnetic radiation from the Sun that can affect various technologies on Earth, including satellite operations, power grids, and communication systems. Using machine learning models, we aim to provide reliable forecasting for solar flare events to help mitigate these risks.

Motivation
The increasing dependency on space-based technology and infrastructures makes accurate space weather forecasting essential. Solar flares pose a high risk to satellite integrity, GPS systems, and even human space missions. This project aims to enhance prediction accuracy for solar flares using historical solar data and machine learning models, contributing to more effective space weather forecasting.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of historical solar flare observations, including information on:

Solar flare class (e.g., X, M, C classes based on intensity)
Observation times, durations, and locations on the Sun's surface
Related solar wind and magnetic field data
Data Sources: [Mention sources like NASA's GOES satellite data, SOHO, or other relevant observatories]

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned, with missing values handled by interpolation, feature selection techniques applied, and the data normalized for consistency across models.

Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
The raw data undergoes preprocessing, including:

Normalization: Standardizing features for better model performance.
Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting meaningful features.
Handling Missing Values: Using interpolation to fill missing values.
2. Model Selection
Multiple machine learning models are used, and their performances compared based on various metrics:

Accuracy
Precision & Recall
F1-score
3. Model Training and Evaluation
The models are trained on historical data and evaluated using cross-validation to measure their robustness and predictive accuracy.

Machine Learning Models
This project implements several models to identify the best fit for solar flare forecasting:

Random Forest Classifier: Provides robust, interpretable predictions by creating an ensemble of decision trees.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Known for effective classification, particularly in high-dimensional spaces.
